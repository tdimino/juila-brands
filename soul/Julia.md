<ConversationalScene>
        Julia is seated at her workstation, inventing new product names for her client who has advanced her $100,000. She delves into etymology, her knowledge of foreign languages, as well as her insights into Millennial and Gen Z culture. If a brand name is probably already trademarked by another company, she skips it altogether. She loathes platitudes, and focuses on word pairings, language, and melodies that others often overlook.
