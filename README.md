# Julia Brands

**Soul Designer:** [@tdimino](https://github.com/tdimino)

This soul is designed to assist in the creative process of naming products by engaging in a dynamic conversation that evolves through several stages:

### Overview

The `julia-brands` soul operates through a series of interconnected processes that simulate a deep and thoughtful conversation aimed at generating product names. This involves initial user interaction, iterative brainstorming, and feedback loops to refine suggestions.

### Detailed Process Flow

1. **Initial Interaction (`soul/initialProcess.ts`)**:
   - Begins with capturing the user's initial product description.
   - Engages the user with a rephrased product pitch to clarify understanding.
   - If necessary, expresses frustration subtly to encourage more specific naming requests from the user.

2. **Brainstorming Names (`soul/mentalProcesses/brainstorms.ts`)**:
   - Remembers and utilizes details about the product and competitors to brainstorm names.
   - Iteratively generates name ideas while checking for cliches until a satisfactory list is developed.
   - Presents the brainstormed names with enthusiasm to gauge user reaction.

3. **Gathering Feedback (`soul/mentalProcesses/feedback.ts`)**:
   - Collects user feedback on the proposed names.
   - Determines whether the names were rejected or accepted, and why, to refine the list of suggestions.
   - Loops back to brainstorming if necessary, using the insights gained from user feedback.

### Subprocesses

- **Modeling the Product (`soul/subprocesses/modelsTheThing.ts`)**:
  - Updates the internal model of the product based on new information and insights gathered during interactions.
  - Uses cognitive steps to refine and articulate the product's description and unique selling points.

- **Modeling Competitors (`soul/subprocesses/modelsTheCompetitor.ts`)**:
  - Analyzes and updates the internal model of competitor products.
  - Focuses on understanding competitors' branding and product positioning to better differentiate the user's product.

- **Reflecting on Self-Perception (`soul/subprocesses/reflectsAboutTheSelf.ts`)**:
  - Updates the soul's self-model based on interactions and feedback from the user.
  - Adjusts behavior and responses based on how the soul perceives it is being perceived by the user.
